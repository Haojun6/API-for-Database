This is the cooperative project I involved. 
I was responsible for data scanning and testing. 
I folked this from the source repo.



## Description
FourthWall is a database monitoring service that allows for easy access to metadata 
relating to PostGresDBs. Using polling these are stored in an external file system 
that can be accessed through the use of an authenticated API. 

## Setup


## API Calls
###To create an API request to the service the following methods can be used:
- Terminal
    While the project is running input following for unix terminal for general GET request
    
    curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/<api_call>/<param_1>/... -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"

- Calls
    For Statistics:
        
        curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/statistics/{schema}/{table} -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
   
    For Long Running Queries:
        
        curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/queries/{from}/{to} -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
   
    For Index Usage 
        
        (Specified Index):
        curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/indexes/{schema}/{table}/{indexName} -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
        
        (All Indexes):
        curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/indexes/{schema}/{table} -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
    
    For Explain Analyse POST request:
        
        curl -X POST https://localhost:<port_number>/api/query/ -H "ApiKey: <api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "<query>;"}'
    
    For All Table Data:
        
        curl -X GET  https://localhost:<port_number>/api/data/{schema}/<auth-key>-{table} -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
    
    For Long Running Queries
        curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/queries/{fromStr?}/{toStr?} -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
        
        fromStr and toStr can be left out and a default value will take its place
        fromStr and toStr take the form "yyyyMMddHHmmssffff" 
        where:
            yyyy = year being searched (2022)
            MM = month being searched  (04)
            dd = day being searched (13)
            HH = hour being searched (04)(24 hour clock)
            mm = minute being searched (30)
            ss = second being searched (33)
            ffff = millisecond being searched (can leave as 0000)
    
    For Open Transactions
        curl -X GET https://localhost:<port_number>/api/transactions -H "ApiKey: <api_key>"
        

## Authentication
###A basic authentication using an API key is used for this template, in later iterations a more secure authentication system would be used. Source stored in Attributes.
###For accessing table data an authorisation key must precede the table name, adding another layer of security to the accessing of this 
###API Key currently found in appsettings.json
###Current auth-key for table data is "auth-" this precedes the table name i.e. auth-student/auth-address
